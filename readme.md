Allows to write an stream of files and direcotire to Amazon S3. 

This library is meant to be used with [fstream](https://github.com/isaacs/fstream/) and it uses [awssum](https://github.com/appsattic/node-awssum) internally.


# Usage

Upload the local directory ```../somelocaldir``` to amazon s3 in the bucket ```buckettt``` and the directory /destination **recursively**.

```js
var Writer = require("fstream-s3").Writer,
	writer = new Writer({
				accessKeyId: "..", 
				secretAccessKey: "..", 
				bucket: "buckettt", 
				region: "...",
				baseDir: "/destination" }),
	reader = fstream.Reader({path: "../somelocaldir", type: 'Directory'});

reader.pipe(writer);

```

# TODO

The writer is very incomplete yet but it does the basic stuff, and there is no reader. Not ready for prime time.
**TESTS***
